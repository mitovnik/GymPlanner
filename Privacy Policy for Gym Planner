This Privacy Policy explains how Gym Planner ("we", "us", "our") handles information when you use the Gym Planner mobile application (the "App").

1) Key points
The App is designed to work without requiring you to create an account.
We do not sell your personal information.
Your workout data is primarily stored on your device, unless you use an optional sync or backup feature provided by your device settings.

2) Information we process
2.1 Data you enter in the App
You may enter information such as:
workouts, exercises, sets, reps, weights
training plans, templates, notes, goals
optional measurements you choose to track
Purpose: to provide core features like planning, logging, and progress tracking.
2.2 Support communications
If you contact us by email, we will receive the information you send, which may include:
your email address
the content of your message
any attachments you choose to include (for example screenshots)
Purpose: to respond to you and resolve issues.
2.3 Technical data (minimal)
The App may process basic technical information needed to function properly on your device (for example, app version, device OS version). This information is typically handled by the operating system and not used to identify you.
Optional diagnostics (only if enabled on your device or in the App): crash reports may include device and app diagnostics to help fix bugs.

3) How we use information
We use information to:
provide App functionality (create plans, log workouts, show history)
save and manage your data on your device
improve reliability and fix issues (for example, via optional crash diagnostics)
respond to support requests

4) Where your data is stored
On-device: Your workout data is stored locally on your device.
Optional backup/sync: If you enable device-level backup or cloud sync (for example via your phone settings), your data may be included in those backups. We do not operate those backup services and do not control their processing.

5) Sharing of information
We do not sell your personal information.
We may share information only in limited cases:
With service providers (if used): If we use a provider for crash diagnostics or app infrastructure, they process limited technical data on our behalf under contractual safeguards.
Legal requirements: If required by law or to protect safety, rights, and security.
With your consent: If you choose to share something (for example exporting data or sending a report).

6) Data retention
Workout data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the App.
Support emails are retained only as long as needed to address your request and comply with legal obligations.

7) Security
We take reasonable measures to protect information. No method of storage is 100% secure, but we work to minimize risk and limit access.

8) Your choices and controls
You can:
edit or delete workout entries inside the App
remove App data by uninstalling the App
control device backups or cloud sync in your phone settings

9) Your privacy rights
Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, or objection to certain processing. If you want to exercise your rights, contact us at info@skyrexio.com. We may need to verify your request.

10) Children’s privacy
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps.

11) Changes to this policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update the effective date and make the new version available in the App Store listing or within the App.
